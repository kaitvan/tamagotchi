# Tamagotchi 2.0

## Description
This project was our first opportunity to practice using JavaScript modules along with Webpack and SASS. The original Tamagotchi toy was a handheld device with an app that allowed the user to care for a digital pet. Our app reimagines the original Tamagotchi app, allowing the user to view four different areas of overall health and see the impact when different buttons are clicked.

### Feature List
The user can increase or descrease the Tamagotchi's overall health with four different actions:
- Eat
- Play
- Fight
- Sleep

## Tech Used
* SASS
* HTML
* JS with ES6 modules
* jQuery
* Webpack configuration
